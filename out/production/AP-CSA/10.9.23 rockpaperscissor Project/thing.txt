Unit_3.16_mini_project: Rock Paper Scissors
(Total: 6 points)
This mini project will practice if/else, Scanner object, while loop, random number generator, and
cumulative sum.
Write a game that plays many rounds of Rock Paper Scissors until "q" is entered.
The user will enter one of three items, and computer will get one from a random generator.
 rock (defeats scissors, but loses to paper),
 paper (defeats rock, but loses to scissors),
 scissors (defeats paper, but loses to rock).
If the player and computer choose the same item, the game is a tie.
After each user input, a verdict will be displayed (user loses, wins, or ties), prompt for another
round.
After user enters "q" (case sensitive), print totally how many times the user wins.
Below is a sample output of this project.
========================================================
Please enter your pick (1--rock, 2--paper, 3--scissor, q--exit): 1
